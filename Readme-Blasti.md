In order to securely authenticate users, the Blasti REST API uses JSON web tokens (JWTs). Upon successful login, a JWT is returned to the user and must be included in the header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints. The JWT is cryptographically signed and can be verified by the server to ensure that it was not tampered with. This allows the server to trust the authenticity of requests made by logged-in users and provide them with access to protected resources. The use of JWTs helps to prevent unauthorized access to the Blasti platform and ensure the security of user data.
